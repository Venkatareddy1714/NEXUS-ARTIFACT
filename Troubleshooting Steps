Step 1: Check your Jenkins Maven version
Go to Jenkins Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Global Tool Configuration
Under Maven, check the configured version.
If not present, click Add Maven, give it a name (e.g., maven-3.8.8)
Check Install automatically and choose a higher version like 3.8.8 or 3.9.6


 Step 2: Verify Nexus Credentials
Log in to Nexus: http://43.204.217.236:8081
Go to Security → Users
Check that: The username you're using exists
It has deployment rights to the maven repository (i.e., role like nx-deployment)

Step 3: Fix Jenkins Credentials
Go to Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Credentials(Usually under (global) → Global credentials)
Ensure a Username with Password credential exists with
Username = Nexus username
Password = Nexus password or token
ID = 2d5d3c2a-15c8-437b-af1b-7940b100bd76 ← This must match what’s used in your pipeline
If not sure, create a new one: Kind: Username with password
ID: nexus-creds Use this updated ID in your pipeline


Steps to Create a New User in Nexus Repository Manager
Login to Nexus as admin
URL: http://43.204.217.236:8081

Go to Settings (gear icon) → Security → Users    Click the + Create local user button
Fill the form:
User ID: jenkins
First name: Jenkins
Last name: User
Email: your-email@example.com
Password: (Set a strong password, note this down for Jenkins)
Status: Active

Next Step in Jenkins
Now update Jenkins with this user:
Go to Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Credentials > Global
Add new "Username with password":  Username: jenkins    Password: the one you just set
ID: nexus-creds
Update your pipeline:

"credentialsId: 'nexus-creds'"
